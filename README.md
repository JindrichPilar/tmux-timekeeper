#Tmux Timekeeper

Tmux Timekeeper (TT) is automatic time tracking plugin for Terminal Multiplexer called Tmux.

##How it works
TT keeps an eye on what pane you are using and records time you spent in each session-window-pane-running\_program.



##Technical information
* Pure SHELL (runs on linux and other posix systems)
* Installable by plugin manager
* Until Tmux implements event system TT uses infinite loop with configurable sleep
