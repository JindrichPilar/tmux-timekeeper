#Contriburing guide

##Common rule
Write tests for your fix/feature.
Before any code submission run tests first. Make sure all of them pases.
All functions should have descriptive name and all their parameters have to be described in comment preceeding function declaration.
Bash scripts can get quite unreadable very fast. Please try to avoid magic solutions. Where unavoidable use propper abstraction.

Write code and tests
Create pull request

##Bug fixes
Write test for bug (it must fail)
